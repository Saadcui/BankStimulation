This JavaFX application simulates basic banking operations. 
It has two main scenes:
First You have to signup.
Login Scene: Users can log in with their username and password. They can also navigate to a sign-up scene.
Create Account Scene: Users can create a new account by entering their details, such as name, phone number, username, and initial balance.

Once logged in, users are taken to the Operations Menu where they can:
Withdraw money.
Deposit money.
Transfer money to other users.
Manage loans (apply, view status, view history, or repay).
Log out to return to the login scene.
Each operation is handled in separate windows that pop up when a user clicks a button. The app also provides basic validation for inputs like balance and amounts for transactions.
